**Sonya age 4**
- Doing feral child things and trying to bite Nori, Nori reactively smacking Sonya by accident and earns her respect while he semi adopts her
- *Smacks Sonya and has a panicked look on his face* "Shit. Hey kid - you okay?"
- *Looks dizzy before shaking her head to clear away her headache* "You strong! Why dumb talk with hob goblin? We attack!"
- *Recognizes her as an orphan, with her parents passing away a year ago. Basically adopts her afterward despite the tribe as a community more or less caring for all orphans already*

**Sonya age 5
- Nori tries to teach her the importance of apologizing, especially in a environment where one might die the next day 
- Sonya doesn't understand the importance, but will apologize if it stops Nori from nagging her
- "Sonya... Do you want your last words with someone to be what you two fought and argued about?"
- "Why not? If we argued, then it means that I'm right and its not *my* fault that I'm right"
- ".... Just apologize if you wrong someone. We'll start small, you *WILL* apologize if I tell you too"

**Sonya any age before 10**
- Nori trying to explain the concept of alliances, deals, and helping others to Sonya
- "So if a better deal comes around, I should give up the current alliance and make a new one?"
- "No Sonya... besides the fact that others will hesitate to make future deals or alliance with you if you do that, you will end up regretting your choices if all that matters to you is a better deal now"
- "I don't get it, why would I regret it if I'm getting something better now?"
- "Is this what people mean when children don't understand object permeance? That if they can't see it now then it doesn't exist in their heads-forget it, Sonya. Just try to do as I say, okay?"

**Sonya age 14**
Sonya watched the tribe lower Zi into ground. Zi and her had never gotten along, always fighting both verbally and physically until someone got in between them. However, despite their hatred of each other, Sonya never thought that this was how Zi was going to die - dying to members of the tribe who had gone mad. Now that Zi was gone, Sonya was officially the youngest in the tribe, with the second youngest being an orc who was 16. 

As she watched Zi's parents wail for her, she couldn't help but to think about the previous leaders of the tribe, Nori and Bera, and how the tribe thrived under their rule. When she was younger, she used to think Nori had weak leadership skills. She remembered how she would stomp up to him and demand him to take the obvious action but he would always give her some enigmatic answer, before sighing and saying that she was too young to understand.

Now that Sonya is older, she's thinks she understands *why* Nori tried to tell her everything he did, even though he knew that his words of wisdom was going in one ear and leaving the other. As she feels a heaviness in her heart, watching Zi's parents kneel and beg as if it would bring their child back to life, she decides she will try to live by the words Nori once tried to tell her, and see if that will lessen the pain in her heart. 

**Sonya age 15**
