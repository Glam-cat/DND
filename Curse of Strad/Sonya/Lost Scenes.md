**Sonya age 6**
"Sonya, you made Zi cry again?" Nori asked disapprovingly as a dragonborn child cries behind him. "Hmph, she started it. I just made sure to end it" Sonya replied, crossing her arms. Sonya hair is filled with sticks and leaves and she has mud streaked all over her face.  

"What did Zi do this time?" Nori sighs, as Bera kneels down next to Zi to apply some salve onto her wounds. "I caught her trying to release those rabbits - you know, the ones being used for lunch today?" 

Nori turns around and looks at Zi. The little dragonborn has a black eye, a busted lip and a big cut on her arm. Nori turns to look back down at Sonya, who is now grumbling as she pulls sticks and leaves out of her hair. "Still, must you hurt her so much? Even if she *did* release those rabbits, we have enough food fo-" 

"NO!" Sonya interrupts angrily, "Rabbit is my favorite. I did the tribe a favor by beating her up! She won't be doing *that* again" Nori looks skyward, as if he's asking for the gods to grant him patience. "Sonya, Zi is four. In her mind, she was just trying to rescue something cute, and the tribe has more than enough food to make up for some missing rabbits. Perhaps you should find it in your heart to go along with her antics." 

Sonya scrunches up her nose. "And why would I do *that*," as she points to the dragonborn who is now wailing as Bera is bandaging her arm. "She's weak and e-ir-ra-shin-ow" as she tries to sound out *irrational*, "and now she'll grow up to be a better member of the tribe!" Sonya ends her sentence smugly. Nori looks like he wants to be anywhere but here, as he looks skyward again. "Have you ever considered letting Zi win, even if it's not the *smart* or *logical* option? Sometimes, the right choices aren't the logical ones..."

"What does that even *mean?* Are you going se-seen-nile already old man?" Sonya askes, as she starts to wipe the mud off her face. Nori looks at Sonya with an unreadable expression before sighing. "I guess you're a little too young now to understand..." and kneels down to help Sonya clean any spots of mud that she missed. "You're on weapons cleaning duty for the rest of the week, and make sure you apologize to Zi before dinner starts."
